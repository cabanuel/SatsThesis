First and foremost a big thank you to Dr. Marcus Stefanou and Jim Horning for believing in me, my project, and supporting me in every possible way. I came to you with a vague idea and a limited amount of time, and with your hard work, motivation, and direction you helped me reach new formidable heights. Thank you also to the Computer Science Department and the Space Systems Academic Group at the Naval Postgraduate School for providing me with the resources and education to make this possible.

To my parents and sister whose constant encouragement and care packages fueled the hard work and writing that went into this thesis I want to say thank you for believing in me.

Thank you to Annathea Cook for the love and support, and for the angry wake up phone calls to make sure I made it to class on time. To DeeDee and Liz, thanks for your support, encouragement, and for all the times I needed someone to talk to. Thanks Dan Gifford for helping come up with the topic of my thesis. and a big thank you to Jay Ellis for feeding me when I was hungry and unable to afford food. 

Special thanks to Devon Ellis for listening to my crazy ideas, helping me become the computer scientist I am today, and for helping me find bugs I wouldn't have otherwise been able to find in my code. Thanks also to Alexis Rogers for listening to me when and for helping me find bugs in my code.

Finally, a thank you to StackOverflow. Without you I would not have been able to survive the last two years or write this thesis.
